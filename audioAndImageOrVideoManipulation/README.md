# Audio and Image/Video Manipulation

Copy a wav file, sample by sample. 
----------------------------------
```
g++ audio/wavCopy.cpp -lsndfile -o audio/copywav

./audio/copywav ./wav_files/sample01.wav ./audio/copiedwav.wav
```

Copy a video, pixel by pixel.
----------------------------------
```

```

Based on the OpenCV library, implement a program to display a video on the screen. You should handle the correct color transformation for display since the color space used in those videos is YUV (in three different subsampling modes 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0).

```

Histograms of an audio sample (left and rigth channel and mono) and corresponding entropy.
----------------------------------
```

```

Histogram of an image/video file (each channel in color and grayscale images) and the corresponding entropy.
----------------------------------

```

Reduce the number of bits used to represent each audio sample (uniform scalar quantization).
----------------------------------
```

```

Reduce the number of bits used to represent each pixel of an image/video.

Print the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the relation between two audio files and the maximum per sample absolute error.
