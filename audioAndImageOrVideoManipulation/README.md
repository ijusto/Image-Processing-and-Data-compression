# Audio and Image/Video Manipulation

#### Copy a wav file, sample by sample. 
```
g++ src/audio/wavCopy.cpp -lsndfile -o build/copywav
  
./build/copywav ./wav_files/sample01.wav ./src/audio/copiedwav.wav
```

#### Copy a video, pixel by pixel.
```

```

#### Display a video on the screen.
```

```

#### Histograms of an audio sample (left and rigth channel and mono) and corresponding entropy.
```

```

#### Histogram of an image/video file (each channel in color and grayscale images) and the corresponding entropy.
```

```

#### Reduce the number of bits used to represent each audio sample (uniform scalar quantization).
```

```

#### Reduce the number of bits used to represent each pixel of an image/video.
```

```

#### Print the SNR of the relation between two audio files, and the maximum per sample absolute error.
