 * Calculates the histogram of an audio sample and corresponding entropy.
 * Calculates the histogram of the left and right channels, as well as the histogram of the average of the channels (the
 * mono version). Note: For visualizing graphically the histograms, you can either save the histogram data as a text
 * file and use an external application to visualize it or you can extend the functionality of the program in order to
 * graphically display the histogram.
